# Promineo

This Repo contains various projects completed for a Coding Bootcamp (with Promineo Tech). Weeks 8 and 9 are exercises in building a connection to a MySQL database
using JDBC. I have build a Java application which will perform basic CRUD operations on the MySQL database directly through the app using JDBC.
